      "Urgent request for decisive EU action regarding grave human-rights violations in Iran",
    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,\n\nI am writing to you as an Iranian national residing in {UserCountry} to urgently draw your attention to the rapidly deteriorating human-rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nSince 8 January 2026, Iranian authorities have imposed a nationwide internet shutdown that has effectively severed the country’s communication with the outside world. This deliberate blackout has obstructed the flow of information, prevented independent documentation of abuses, and left many Iranians abroad—including myself—unable to contact family members inside Iran. Credible reporting by Amnesty International confirms that this shutdown has been used to conceal grave human-rights violations.\n\nDuring this period, widespread protests—driven by demands for fundamental freedoms and by severe economic hardship, including collapsing living standards and the devaluation of wages—have been met with unlawful and excessive force. Amnesty International and other reputable organizations have documented verified video evidence and credible eyewitness accounts indicating mass unlawful killings, including the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has publicly condemned the killing of peaceful demonstrators and has rejected the Iranian authorities’ systematic practice of labeling protesters as “terrorists” in order to justify lethal repression.\n\nThese acts—including unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and the deliberate suppression of information—constitute serious violations of international human-rights law and may amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nIn light of the gravity and scale of these violations, I respectfully urge you, as a Member of the European Parliament, to advocate for and support concrete and immediate measures, including:\n\nInitiating a formal review of the European Union’s diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic relations where lawful and appropriate;\n\nFormally supporting the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization under EU law, in light of its central role in systematic repression, unlawful killings, and transnational intimidation;\n\nExpanding, strengthening, and rigorously enforcing targeted EU sanctions against individuals, entities, and institutions responsible for serious human-rights violations, including IRGC-affiliated bodies;\n\nSupporting the establishment and continuation of an independent international investigative and evidence-preservation mechanism, including through action at the United Nations Human Rights Council, to ensure accountability and future prosecution;\n\nApplying sustained diplomatic and political pressure to compel the immediate restoration of full internet access and an end to the use of lethal force against civilians;\n\nAdvocating for emergency protection and asylum pathways for individuals at imminent risk, particularly detainees facing torture, enforced disappearance, or execution.\n\nThe European Union has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to human dignity, the rule of law, and the protection of fundamental rights. At this critical moment, decisive action is essential to ensure that these principles are upheld and that those responsible for grave abuses are not allowed to act with impunity.\n\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter and for your continued commitment to the protection of human rights.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,
