      "Urgent request for decisive EU action on Iran’s crackdown and nationwide internet blackout",
    body: `Your Excellency {RecipientTitle} {RecipientLastName},\n\nI am writing to you as an Iranian living in {UserCity}, {UserCountry} to urgently draw your attention to the escalating human-rights crisis in Iran.\n\nSince 8 January 2026, Iranian authorities have imposed a nationwide internet blackout that has effectively cut the country off from the outside world and obstructed communication and documentation. Many of us abroad have lost contact with our families inside Iran. ([Amnesty International][1])\n\nDuring this blackout, protests—driven by demands for basic freedoms and by economic hardship, including collapsing living standards and the devaluation of salaries—have been met with unlawful violence. Amnesty International and other organizations have cited verified videos and credible accounts indicating mass unlawful killings, including the use of live ammunition against civilians. ([Amnesty International][1])\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned the killing of peaceful demonstrators and rejected the authorities’ practice of labeling protesters as “terrorists” to justify violence. ([OHCHR][2])\n\nThese acts—unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, and the deliberate suppression of information—constitute serious violations of international human-rights law and may amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nI respectfully urge you to move beyond statements of concern and support immediate action, including:\n\n* A formal review and downgrading of diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, including diplomatic measures where lawful and appropriate;\n* Expanded and enforced targeted sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for repression;\n* Support for an urgent independent international investigation and evidence-preservation mechanisms (including action through the UN Human Rights Council);\n* Sustained pressure to restore full internet access and end the use of lethal force against civilians;\n* Emergency protection and asylum pathways for those at imminent risk, including detainees facing execution.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}\n\n[1]: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/01/iran-massacre-of-protesters-demands-global-diplomatic-action-to-signal-an-end-to-impunity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Iran: Massacre of protesters demands global diplomatic action to signal an end to impunity"\n[2]: https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/iran-un-human-rights-chief-urges-authorities-end-violent-repression-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Iran: UN Human Rights Chief urges authorities to end ..."`,
