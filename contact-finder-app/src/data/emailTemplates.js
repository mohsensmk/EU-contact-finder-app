    subject: "Genocide in Iran: Europe’s Delay Is Costing Lives",
    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

I am writing as an Iranian citizen and as a voice for thousands who can no longer speak because they have been executed in the streets of their own country.

What is unfolding in Iran is not political unrest, not civil disorder, and not a security response. It is genocide and crimes against humanity, carried out deliberately by the Islamic Republic against its own population.

Since late December, verified hospital and emergency data confirms that at least 16,500 people have been killed and more than 330,000 injured across all provinces of Iran . The majority of victims are young civilians. Many were shot directly in the head, neck, or chest. Snipers have been deployed on rooftops. Military-grade weapons are being used in residential areas.

Doctors report mass eye injuries, including over a thousand people permanently blinded. Even more disturbingly, security forces have actively blocked blood transfusions, causing preventable deaths inside hospitals. This is not negligence — it is intentional killing through medical deprivation.

On 8 January, the regime imposed a nationwide internet blackout to conceal these crimes. Morgues overflowed with bodies. Families searching for missing relatives were threatened into silence. This blackout is not a technical measure — it is a weapon designed to hide mass murder.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is the primary executor of this violence. Its actions meet every threshold for terrorist designation. Continued EU hesitation to name it as such sends a catastrophic signal of tolerance.

Appeasement has failed. Dialogue has failed.
Continued engagement now constitutes complicity.

The Iranian people are not asking for reform. They are demanding the end of a regime that survives only through bloodshed.

Europe must act — decisively and immediately.

History will record whether the European Union stood with the victims, or shielded their executioners through inaction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

    subject: "Iran: Crimes Against Humanity Demand Immediate EU Action",
    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

I write to you at a moment when silence has become lethal.

The Islamic Republic of Iran is conducting a systematic campaign of mass killing against its civilian population. This campaign has already resulted in over 16,500 deaths and more than 330,000 injuries, according to compiled hospital data . These figures are not estimates from activists — they are medical records.

The pattern of violence is unmistakable: targeted shootings, snipers aiming for the head, widespread use of military ammunition, and deliberate denial of medical treatment. Children, pregnant women, and uninvolved civilians are among the victims.

This is not crowd control. It is the intentional destruction of a population segment for political purposes — a textbook definition of genocide under international law.

The nationwide internet shutdown imposed in January was a calculated effort to erase evidence and prevent international scrutiny while killings accelerated. No state acting in good faith behaves this way.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates as a terrorist entity, both domestically and through foreign proxies. Its exclusion from the EU terrorist list is no longer a legal ambiguity — it is a political failure.

The Iranian people are explicitly demanding regime change. Continued diplomatic engagement grants legitimacy to mass murder.

Europe must choose:
law and accountability — or silence and complicity.

This moment will define Europe’s moral credibility for decades.\n\nThank you for your attention and your dedication to human rights.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

    subject: "The Iranian People Are Being Slaughtered While Europe Waits",
    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

Every delay costs lives.

As you read this, Iranian civilians are being executed in streets, homes, and hospitals. Since December, at least 16,500 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands injured in a coordinated campaign of state violence .

Victims are overwhelmingly young. Many never protested. They were shot while walking, filming, or trying to help others. Snipers target heads. Doctors describe bodies torn by shrapnel. Patients bleed to death because blood transfusions are blocked by security forces.

This is not a crisis. It is a massacre.

The regime’s internet blackout was designed to ensure that Europe would debate words while bodies accumulated in morgues. Families are terrorized into silence. Evidence is destroyed. This is how modern genocide is carried out.

Appeasement has not reduced violence — it has accelerated it.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is the machinery of this killing. Failing to designate it as a terrorist organization sends a message that European red lines do not exist.

The Iranian people are demanding freedom, dignity, and the end of a regime built on terror. They are paying for this demand with their lives.

Europe must act now — not tomorrow, not after another statement, not after another mass grave.

History is watching. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

What is happening in Iran will define Europe’s moral standing.

More than 16,500 people have been killed in weeks. Over 330,000 injured. Snipers, live ammunition, blocked medical care, internet blackouts, mass intimidation .

This is not ambiguous.
This is not complex.
This is genocide.

The Islamic Republic is exterminating dissent through terror. The IRGC is the execution arm. Every day it remains undesignated as a terrorist organization is a day Europe fails its own values.

The Iranian people are not asking for negotiations with their killers. They are asking the world to stop legitimizing them.

Appeasement is no longer caution.
It is participation through inaction.

Do not let Europe be remembered for choosing comfort over courage. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

Words matter. What is happening in Iran is not a crackdown — it is genocide.

More than 16,500 people have been killed, with gunshot wounds to the head and chest, and hundreds of thousands injured . Doctors describe mass eye injuries and preventable deaths caused by blocked medical care.

The IRGC is carrying out these crimes openly. The internet blackout exists solely to hide them.

Appeasement emboldens killers.

The EU must respond with forceful measures, not concern. The Iranian people are watching. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

Every hour of inaction costs Iranian lives.

Since December, the Islamic Republic has killed over 16,500 people in a nationwide crackdown that includes snipers, mass shootings, and deliberate medical deprivation . Victims are overwhelmingly young.

This is not law enforcement. It is state terror.

The internet shutdown imposed on 8 January was designed to hide genocide. Bodies in morgues cannot be debated away.

Iranian citizens are demanding regime change. Continued engagement strengthens their executioners.

I urge you to act with moral clarity:

Terrorist designation of the IRGC

Diplomatic isolation of the regime

Immediate pressure to restore internet access

Iran is not experiencing unrest. It is experiencing extermination.

Independent medical data confirms 16,500–18,000 killed and over 330,000 injured since late December . These numbers reflect a state-run killing operation, not crowd dispersal.

Snipers on rooftops, live ammunition, and military hardware are being used against civilians. Hospitals are under siege. Internet access has been cut to erase evidence.

This satisfies the legal definition of genocide and crimes against humanity.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is the central executioner. Its continued exclusion from the EU terrorist list is indefensible.

Appeasement has become complicity.

The EU must act now — not with statements, but with consequences.

    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

The Iranian people are being killed in real time, and Europe’s restraint is being read as permission.

Since December, security forces of the Islamic Republic — led by the IRGC — have murdered over 16,500 civilians and injured hundreds of thousands more . These killings are intentional, targeted, and systematic. Victims are shot in the head and chest. Children have been blinded. Pregnant women have been wounded.

Doctors report that lives are being lost not only to bullets, but because security forces prevent blood transfusions. This is collective punishment. This is genocide.

The regime’s nationwide internet blackout is a deliberate strategy to hide mass murder. No government committing such acts deserves diplomatic engagement.

Enough appeasement.

The EU must:

List the IRGC as a terrorist entity

Sever diplomatic legitimacy from the Islamic Republic

Act to restore Iran’s internet immediately

The Iranian people are not asking for reforms.
They are demanding the end of a killing regime.

Do not let Europe be remembered for hesitation.\n\nThank you for your attention and your dedication to human rights.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,

    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

I write to you as an Iranian citizen and as a witness, in exile, to the mass killing of my people.

What is currently happening in Iran constitutes genocide and crimes against humanity. Since late December, the Islamic Republic has carried out a coordinated campaign of mass executions and indiscriminate killing across all provinces. Verified hospital data confirms at least 16,500 killed and more than 330,000 injured, many of them children and young adults .

This is not crowd control. This is extermination. Snipers are firing at civilians’ heads, military-grade weapons are being deployed in residential areas, and hospitals are being weaponized by blocking blood transfusions to the wounded.

On 8 January, the regime deliberately shut down the internet nationwide to conceal its crimes. Bodies are stacked in morgues. Families are terrorized into silence.

Appeasement has failed. Dialogue has failed.
Continued engagement is enabling slaughter.

I urge you to immediately:

Designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization

End political normalization with the Islamic Republic

Force the restoration of internet access

Publicly recognize the Iranian people’s demand for regime change

History will remember who acted — and who stayed silent.

      "Genocide in Iran – Appeasement Has Failed, Immediate EU Action Required",
    body: `Dear Member of the European Parliament,

I am writing to you as an Iranian citizen and as a voice for a people who are being systematically slaughtered while the world debates and delays.

What is unfolding in Iran is not unrest, not civil disturbance, and not an internal matter.
It is genocide.

Since late December, the Islamic Republic of Iran has launched a nationwide campaign of mass killing against its own population. According to verified hospital data, at least 16,500 people have been killed and more than 330,000 injured, many of them civilians, children, and young people under the age of 30 . These are not protest-related casualties — they are execution-style killings.

Security forces, led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its Basij militia, are using military-grade weapons, snipers on rooftops, and direct headshots. Doctors report gunshot and shrapnel wounds to the head, neck, and chest. Over 1,000 people have lost their eyes. Victims are dying not only from bullets, but because security forces are blocking blood transfusions in hospitals .

On 8 January, the regime imposed a near-total internet blackout, deliberately plunging the country into digital darkness to conceal mass murder. Bodies have been piled in and around morgues. Families searching for missing relatives are threatened into silence. This is the calculated destruction of a people under cover of isolation.

Let us be clear:
This meets the legal threshold of genocide and crimes against humanity.

And yet, the European Union continues a policy of appeasement.

Appeasement has failed.
Dialogue has failed.
Statements of “concern” have failed.

The Iranian people are not asking for negotiations with their executioners.
They are demanding action.

Therefore, I urge you to act immediately and decisively:

Formally designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization without delay. It is directly responsible for mass killings inside Iran and through foreign proxy forces abroad.

End all political and diplomatic normalization with the Islamic Republic. A regime committing genocide has no legitimacy.

Use every available legal, diplomatic, and economic mechanism to force the immediate restoration of the internet, which is being used as a weapon of mass repression.

Publicly acknowledge that the Iranian people are demanding regime change, not reform. Continued engagement only prolongs bloodshed.

History will not judge Europe by its statements, but by whether it acted while thousands were being executed in real time.

The Iranian people are being killed for demanding freedom.
They are being executed for asking for dignity.
And they are watching to see whether Europe stands with them — or with their killers.

Appeasement is no longer neutrality.
It is complicity. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n{UserName}`,
